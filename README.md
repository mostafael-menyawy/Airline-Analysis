🌟 Objective
This project seeks to:

Deepen understanding of air travel trends and how they affect operational performance.
Identify areas of improvement to enhance efficiency and passenger satisfaction across various airline services.

📊 Scope of Analysis
Our analysis focuses on the following key areas:

Passenger Demographics: Analyzing gender, age, and nationality distribution.
Flight Performance: Tracking flight statuses, delays, and cancellations.
Operational Metrics: Measuring key performance indicators (KPIs) such as flight frequencies by month and quarter.
Geographical Analysis: Studying travel routes, with a focus on key countries like the USA, Australia, Guinea, Brazil, and China.
Trends: Identifying patterns in travel behavior over different periods, including peak seasons and busy routes.

🛠️ Technologies and Tools
Power BI: All analysis and visualization were conducted using Power BI, leveraging its powerful capabilities for creating insightful and interactive dashboards.


🔍 Insights Uncovered
Some of the key insights discovered in the analysis include:

Passenger Patterns: Most passengers travel between a few key routes, with certain months seeing significantly higher flight traffic.
Performance Metrics: The most common flight delays were observed in specific regions, allowing for targeted improvements.
Geographical Trends: Countries like the USA and China are prominent in global flight routes, making them critical hubs for further analysis.

🚀 Key Insights and Recommendations
1. Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty
Insight: A significant number of flights were delayed or canceled, impacting customer satisfaction.
Recommendation: Develop programs offering compensation (e.g., vouchers, loyalty points) for flight disruptions to enhance customer loyalty and mitigate dissatisfaction.
